Maze Generator by unionning graphs

Considering this "maze under construction" where every " - " is a node.

We add the center node to the vector 'a' which has all the nodes that have neighbours that are not in 'a'.
while a is not empty, we choose a random node from it and put in a vector 'vec' all its adiacent nodes that are not in 'a'.
We choose randomly a node from 'vec' and add him to 'a' while "breaking the wall between these nodes.

Repeat until there is only one graph

And then solve it using backtracking

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ..    13
+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 1
|   |       |     >   >   2
